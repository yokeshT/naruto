                <P>He decides to confront him in a battle which could end both their lives should Naruto be unable to save him.[86] He prepares himself for the upcoming fight by becoming a student under the vessel of the Eight-Tails, Killer B, to take full control of Kurama's powers. He succeeds with help from his late mother, Kushina Uzumaki, who placed a chakra imprint of herself within the seal so when the time comes, she could have a chance to see her son again.[87][88] When Naruto learns that all his comrades are battling Tobi's army to protect him, he takes Killer B to join him in the battle, eventually cooperating with Kurama.[89][90] As he fights, Naruto meets Hagoromo ÅŒtsutsuki, the Sage of the Six Paths, who grants him enhanced Senjutsu known as the Six Paths Senjutsu.[91][92] After he and Sasuke join forces to face both Tobi and Madara who are using the Ten-Tails, they have to seal a bigger threat named Kaguya ÅŒtsutsuki, who is in her Ten-Tails form.[93] After defeating and sealing Kaguya with the cooperation of the rest of Team 7, Naruto ends up having to fight Sasuke due to their conflicting views regarding the ninja world's future.[94] As both end up losing an arm, Naruto and Sasuke reconcile.[95] He receives a new arm created from the First Hokage's cells later.[96] Years later, Naruto is married to Hinata with whom he has had two children â€“ Boruto and Himawari Uzumaki.
